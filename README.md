# Booking Clone

Booking.com is a website that allows users to compare hotel prices and make reservations. In this personal project, a clone of the main page of Booking.com has been created to learn more in detail how to implement **images** and how **carousels** works. Also, I learnt how use one of the most popular frameworks, **React**, and improve my **SASS** skills.
